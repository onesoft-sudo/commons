* OSN Commons

OSN Commons is a collection of reusable code and components
designed to simplify the development of software projects. Inspired by
GNULib, OSN Commons provides you a wide range of functionalities that
can be easily integrated into your projects, giving you a smooth
development experience so that you can focus on important things.

** Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

**** Download OSN Commons

You can clone the entire repository:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  git clone https://github.com/onesoft-sudo/commons.git
#+END_SRC
Or, you can browse the code, and pick the tools you need and only
download them. Most of these programs and tools are standalone.

**** Requirements

Ensure that you have the required runtimes installed to be able to
use some of the programs included in OSN commons. Here is the full
list of tools you need to have installed:

+ Node.js v20 or later
+ A POSIX-compliant shell (e.g. Dash)
      
**** Include the tools in your project

You can just copy and paste these programs into your project, as
most of these are standalone and will work as expected.
We recommend putting these tools inside a specific directory like
=build-aux= or =scripts=.
